**Why Kronos?**
To be honest, I too don't have the answer.I was in the lobby of a multiplayer computer game and had to choose a name for my character. 'Kronos' popped up in my head and since then it has stuck around. I decided to extend it to my blog website and give it a symbol. And there you have it!!!

I am a junior undergraduate in the Computer Science department at IIT Kanpur. Currently I am interested in Computer Networks, Cryptography and Machine Learning. I like to explore topics in Science and Technology in general.

I always wanted to start a blog website. But I was fearful. My mind was filled with all sorts of fears and ideas: whether I should start a blog website, whether people will like my blogs, will my blog suck, what would my friends say about my blog and other similar thoughts. Then, I found this amazing [**video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyVpRiqOvt4) (the title of the video is not what you think it is) which completely changed my perspective on this. I would sincerely suggest everyone to watch this video once (especially if you want to start your own blog website or a youtube channel).

**How I created this website?** Well, I used [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io), a static site generator. I chose this pre-built theme, amongst others, from [here](https://themes.gohugo.io). It already had a variety of shortcodes which I would require in my future blogs and I found it simple and easy. There are many tutorials available for Hugo on Youtube. I found this [tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtIqKaDlqXo&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3) particularly useful. Should you use a pre-built theme? Yes, if your main purpose is to have a site up and running as early as possible. Still, its your choice if you want to build a website from scratch.

I will keep on updating this website, adding new features as we go along and also keep on publishing blogs regularly.
