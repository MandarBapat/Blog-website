Hey visitor, welcome to my blog website!!!

A guide to using this website:

1. The **Home** page is the page you are currently in, i.e., this page.
2. The **Blog** page contains lists all the blogs and articles. You can use the search bar to find a particular blog.
3. The **Tags** page lists all the tags. It also contains a search bar to search for the relevant tags.
4. The **About** page contains a bit of information about me and this blog website.

Down below, you will find an option to turn on and off the **darkmode**.
Below that, you will find links to my social media handles.

To find a particular article or blog, I would suggest you first go to the **Tags** section, search for a particular tag and then select the article you want to read. This approach would reduce your search space from the start and help you to find your article faster.
