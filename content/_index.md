Hey visitor, welcome to my blog website!!!

A guide to using this website:

1. The **Home** page is the page you are currently in, i.e., this page.
2. The **Blog** page contains lists all the blogs and articles. You can use the search bar to find a particular blog.
3. The **Tags** page lists all the tags.
4. The **About** page contains a bit of information about me and this blog website.
5. Below every page, you will find an option to turn on and off the **darkmode**. Below that, you will find links to my social media handles.
6. Each blog will have a table of contents with internal links so that you can skip to the section you want. Below each blog, there will be an option to post a comment. Click on **Show comments** to display the various comment options.

I will keep on posting articles and blogs regularly. Every now and then I will also keep on updating the site, maybe to add new features or to correct an error. If you like an article, do comment and share. Also, if you find an error in a blog, mention it in the comments below the blog and I would be happy to correct it.
